Executive Summary This document outlines PM33's recommended pricing strategy based on an Intelligence Operations model with aggressive pricing to maximize market capture. Our analysis shows that starting at $29/month (vs. $99) could accelerate us to $125K MRR with 4,000 customers by Month 9, creating a defensible market position through volume and network effects. **Key Recommendation**: Adopt aggressive pricing ($29 entry) with Intelligence Operations model to prioritize market capture over initial ARPU. --- ## 1.
