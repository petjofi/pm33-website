# PM33: Realistic Path to $100K MRR 

## Executive Summary

**Target**: $100,000 MRR by December 31, 2025 **Timeline**: 20 weeks from launch (August 18 - December 31) **Strategy**: Intelligence Operations pricing with realistic churn modeling **Key Adjustment**: Beta users are free; churn rates vary by tier **Required**: 5,200 gross customer additions to achieve 3,500 paying customers

---

## Critical Adjustments from Original Model

### What's Changed

1. **Beta Period**: First 100 users are FREE (validation only)
2. **Churn Modeling**: 5% blended monthly churn rate included
3. **Acquisition Target**: 5,200 gross adds (vs 3,500 net)
4. **Timeline Extension**: First revenue in Week 3 (not Week 1)
5. **CAC Budget**: Increased to $180K (from $105K)

### The Reality Check

- **Weeks 1-2**: Zero revenue (beta validation)
- **Week 3**: First paying customers
- **Week 15**: Hit $100K MRR (2 weeks later than original)
- **Week 20**: $118K MRR (sustainable growth)

## Churn Rate Model by Customer Segment

### Industry-Validated Assumptions

|Tier|Monthly Price|Monthly Churn|Annual Retention|Avg Lifetime|LTV|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Starter**|$29|6%|48%|17 months|$493|
|**Team**|$79|4%|62%|25 months|$1,975|
|**Scale**|$199|2.5%|74%|40 months|$7,960|
|**Enterprise**|$599|1.5%|84%|67 months|$40,133|
|**Blended**|~$65|**5%**|**54%**|**20 months**|**$1,300**|

### Churn Timing Distribution

|Period|% of Total Churn|Primary Reason|
|---|---|---|
|Week 1|20%|Poor fit/wrong expectations|
|Week 2-4|35%|Didn't achieve first value|
|Month 2-3|25%|Budget constraints|
|Month 4-6|15%|Found alternative solution|
|Month 7+|5%|Natural attrition|

## Beta to Revenue Transition Model

### Weeks 1-4: Beta Foundation

|Week|Activity|Users|Paying|MRR|Focus|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|**1**|Private beta launch|25|0|$0|Product validation|
|**2**|Expand beta|100|0|$0|PMF confirmation|
|**3**|Public launch|250|150|$4,350|First revenue|
|**4**|Scale launch|500|400|$11,600|Growth validation|

### Beta Conversion Strategy

**Week 1-2 Beta Users (100 total)**

- 100% free during beta
- 60% convert to paid in Week 3
- 40% churn (wrong fit)
- **Net: 60 paying customers from beta**

**Why Lower Beta Conversion?**

- Free users include tire-kickers
- No payment commitment = lower quality
- Some just wanted early access
- Others were competitors/researchers

## Team Alignment Actions

### Immediate Decisions Needed

1. **Approve free beta period** (Weeks 1-2)
    
    - Pro: Better product validation
    - Con: Delays revenue by 2 weeks
2. **Accept 5% churn reality**
    
    - Pro: Realistic planning
    - Con: Requires 49% more acquisitions
3. **Commit to $183K CAC budget**
    
    - Pro: Achievable growth
    - Con: Higher capital requirement
4. **Target Week 15 for $100K**
    
    - Pro: Realistic with buffer
    - Con: 2 weeks later than ideal

### Success Criteria

## Conclusion

This realistic model acknowledges that:

1. **Beta users don't pay initially** - We need validation before monetization
2. **Churn is inevitable** - 5% monthly is actually good for our price point
3. **More acquisitions needed** - 5,200 gross for 3,500 net paying
4. **Timeline extends slightly** - Week 15 vs Week 13 for $100K
5. **Investment increases** - $183K CAC budget vs $105K original

**But the goal remains achievable** with disciplined execution and realistic expectations.

### The Bottom Line

**Week 15 (November 24, 2025): $103,565 MRR**

- 4,175 paying customers
- 5% monthly churn
- $35 average CAC
- 20 months average customer lifetime
- Clear path to $200K MRR by Q1 2026

_This model is aggressive but achievable with proper execution and capital._
