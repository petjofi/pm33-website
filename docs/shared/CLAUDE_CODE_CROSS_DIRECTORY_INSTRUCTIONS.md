Claude Code Cross-Directory Setup for PM33 Website Development ## üóÇÔ∏è Directory Structure & Context You have two critical directories that must work together: ``` Desktop/my-projects/ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ PM33/ # Marketing & Content Strategy ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md # ‚≠ê Community-driven organic growth strategy ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ EXECUTION_PLAN.md # ‚≠ê Content marketing execution details ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ GTM.md # Go-to-market strategy ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ keywords.md # Target keywords with intent levels ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ competitors.md # Competitor analysis ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pm33_100k_mrr_plan.md # Revenue plan with automation ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ideas/ # Keyword research & content briefs ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ examples/ # Platform-specific content examples ‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ linkedin/ ‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ twitter/ ‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ reddit/ ‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ youtube/ ‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Templates/ # Content templates for each platform ‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ pm33-claude-execution/ # Technical Implementation ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app/frontend/ # Next.js marketing website ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ marketing/ # Marketing automation code ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ strategy/ # Strategic documents ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ PM33_WEBSITE_REQUIREMENTS.md # (New file to create) ``` ## üìã Step-by-Step Setup Instructions ### Step 1: Create a Bridge Configuration File In the `pm33-claude-execution` directory, create a context file that references both projects: ```bash cd ~/Desktop/my-projects/pm33-claude-execution mkdir -p .claude touch .claude/project-bridge.md ``` **Content for `.claude/project-bridge.md`:** ```markdown # PM33 Website Development - Multi-Directory Context ## Directory Locations - Marketing Context: ~/Desktop/my-projects/PM33/ - Technical Implementation: ~/Desktop/my-projects/pm33-claude-execution/ ## Critical Documents to Reference ### Marketing & Content Strategy (PM33 directory) 1. **README.md** - Community-driven organic growth strategy - Defines content tone: peer-to-peer, not corporate - Platform strategies for LinkedIn, X, Reddit, YouTube - Templates for sustainable content creation 2. **EXECUTION_PLAN.md** - Content marketing execution - Keyword research and prioritization process - Content creation workflow across platforms - SEO optimization strategy - Success metrics and KPIs 3. **GTM.md** - Positioning and messaging - Target audience definitions - Competitive differentiation - Value propositions 4. **keywords.md** - SEO targets - High-intent conversion keywords - Research-intent content keywords - Platform-specific keyword strategies ### Technical Implementation (pm33-claude-execution directory) - Frontend: app/frontend/ (Next.js) - Design System: APP_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md - Architecture: PM33_DATA_REQUIREMENTS_ARCHITECTURE.md ``` ### Step 2: Create Website Requirements with Cross-References Create the main requirements file that explicitly references both directories: ```bash cd ~/Desktop/my-projects/pm33-claude-execution touch PM33_WEBSITE_REQUIREMENTS_UNIFIED.md ``` **Add this header to the requirements:** ```markdown # PM33 Website Requirements - Unified Strategy ## üìÅ CRITICAL: Cross-Directory Requirements This website implementation requires content from TWO directories: ### Marketing Content Source **Directory**: `~/Desktop/my-projects/PM33/` **Key Files**: - `README.md` - Defines our community-first approach - `EXECUTION_PLAN.md` - Content creation and keyword strategy ### Technical Implementation **Directory**: `~/Desktop/my-projects/pm33-claude-execution/` **Location**: `app/frontend/` for website code ## üéØ Implementation Philosophy (from PM33/README.md) Per the organic growth strategy in PM33/README.md: - **Community-First**: We're peers, not vendors - **Authentic Engagement**: Real conversations, not corporate speak - **Multi-Platform**: Coordinated presence across LinkedIn, X, Reddit, YouTube - **Content Templates**: Use templates from PM33/Templates/ directory ## üìä Keyword & Content Strategy (from PM33/EXECUTION_PLAN.md) Following the execution plan: ### Phase 1: Keyword Implementation - Priority keywords from PM33/keywords.md - Research examples in PM33/examples/[platform]/ - Apply SEO strategies from EXECUTION_PLAN.md sections ### Phase 2: Content Integration - Blog posts following PM33/ideas/ briefs - Social proof from PM33/examples/ - Platform-specific adaptations per EXECUTION_PLAN.md [Rest of the website requirements...] ``` ### Step 3: Initialize Claude Code with Both Directories **Option A: Create a Unified Command Script** ```bash cd ~/Desktop/my-projects/pm33-claude-execution touch claude-website-init.sh chmod +x claude-website-init.sh ``` **Content for `claude-website-init.sh`:** ```bash #!/bin/bash # Set up environment variables for both directories export PM33_MARKETING_DIR="$HOME/Desktop/my-projects/PM33" export PM33_EXECUTION_DIR="$HOME/Desktop/my-projects/pm33-claude-execution" # Create symbolic links for easy access ln -sf $PM33_MARKETING_DIR/README.md marketing-readme.md ln -sf $PM33_MARKETING_DIR/EXECUTION_PLAN.md marketing-execution.md ln -sf $PM33_MARKETING_DIR/keywords.md marketing-keywords.md ln -sf $PM33_MARKETING_DIR/Templates marketing-templates echo "PM33 Website Development Environment Ready" echo "Marketing Context: $PM33_MARKETING_DIR" echo "Technical Implementation: $PM33_EXECUTION_DIR" ``` ### Step 4: Claude Code Initialization Commands **Initial Context Setting:** ```bash claude "I'm building the PM33 marketing website. I have two directories to work with: 1. Marketing strategy in ~/Desktop/my-projects/PM33/ - Read README.md and EXECUTION_PLAN.md there 2. Technical implementation in ~/Desktop/my-projects/pm33-claude-execution/ Start by reading: - ~/Desktop/my-projects/PM33/README.md for our community-driven approach - ~/Desktop/my-projects/PM33/EXECUTION_PLAN.md for keyword and content strategy - ./PM33_WEBSITE_REQUIREMENTS_UNIFIED.md for technical requirements Then implement the website in app/frontend/ following both the marketing strategy and technical specs." ``` ### Step 5: Working Commands for Cross-Directory Development **For Content Integration:** ```bash claude "Create blog post templates based on: - Content strategy from ~/Desktop/my-projects/PM33/EXECUTION_PLAN.md - Keywords from ~/Desktop/my-projects/PM33/keywords.md - Examples from ~/Desktop/my-projects/PM33/examples/ Implement in app/frontend/app/blog/" ``` **For Landing Pages:** ```bash claude "Build landing pages using: - Keywords from ~/Desktop/my-projects/PM33/keywords.md (high-intent section) - Messaging from ~/Desktop/my-projects/PM33/GTM.md - Templates from ~/Desktop/my-projects/PM33/Templates/ Place in app/frontend/app/(landing-pages)/" ``` **For Social Proof:** ```bash claude "Implement testimonial sections using: - Examples from ~/Desktop/my-projects/PM33/examples/linkedin/ - Community tone from ~/Desktop/my-projects/PM33/README.md - Trust-building approach from ~/Desktop/my-projects/PM33/EXECUTION_PLAN.md" ``` ## üîÑ Continuous Context Maintenance ### Create a Context Reminder File ```bash cd ~/Desktop/my-projects/pm33-claude-execution touch .claude-remember.md ``` **Content for `.claude-remember.md`:** ```markdown # Always Remember - PM33 Website Development ## Two Directory Context 1. ALWAYS check ~/Desktop/my-projects/PM33/README.md for marketing approach 2. ALWAYS follow ~/Desktop/my-projects/PM33/EXECUTION_PLAN.md for content strategy 3. Implement in pm33-claude-execution/app/frontend/ ## Key Principles from README.md - Community-first approach (not corporate) - Peer-to-peer communication - Organic growth through authentic engagement - Use templates from PM33/Templates/ ## Content Strategy from EXECUTION_PLAN.md - Week 1: Keyword research and prioritization - Week 2: Content example collection - Week 3-4: Content creation sprint - Multi-platform coordination (LinkedIn, X, Reddit, YouTube) ## Success Metrics (from both docs) - 50+ leads per week - Top 10 rankings for primary keywords - 10+ content pieces per week - $100K MRR by EOY 2025 ``` ## üöÄ Quick Start Commands ### Complete Website Foundation with Both Contexts: ```bash claude "Build PM33 marketing website foundation: 1. Read marketing strategy from ~/Desktop/my-projects/PM33/README.md 2. Follow content plan from ~/Desktop/my-projects/PM33/EXECUTION_PLAN.md 3. Use keywords from ~/Desktop/my-projects/PM33/keywords.md 4. Implement in ./app/frontend/ with Next.js and Mantine UI 5. Ensure community-first tone and peer-to-peer messaging throughout" ``` ### Verify Alignment: ```bash claude "Verify the website implementation: - Does it follow the community-driven approach from ~/Desktop/my-projects/PM33/README.md? - Are we using keywords from ~/Desktop/my-projects/PM33/keywords.md? - Is the content strategy aligned with ~/Desktop/my-projects/PM33/EXECUTION_PLAN.md? - List any misalignments and fix them" ``` ## üìù Pro Tips for Cross-Directory Work 1. **Always Reference Full Paths**: Be explicit about which directory ```bash claude "Use keywords from ~/Desktop/my-projects/PM33/keywords.md, not local keywords" ``` 2. **Create Symbolic Links**: For frequently used files ```bash ln -s ~/Desktop/my-projects/PM33/README.md marketing-strategy.md ``` 3. **Regular Sync Checks**: Ensure alignment between directories ```bash claude "Compare website content with ~/Desktop/my-projects/PM33/EXECUTION_PLAN.md sections" ``` 4. **Use Environment Variables**: In your code ```javascript // app/frontend/config/paths.js export const MARKETING_DIR = process.env.PM33_MARKETING_DIR || '~/Desktop/my-projects/PM33' export const EXECUTION_DIR = process.env.PM33_EXECUTION_DIR || '~/Desktop/my-projects/pm33-claude-execution' ``` ## ‚úÖ Validation Checklist Before considering any section complete: - [ ] Content aligns with PM33/README.md community approach - [ ] Keywords implemented from PM33/keywords.md - [ ] Following execution timeline from PM33/EXECUTION_PLAN.md - [ ] Using templates from PM33/Templates/ - [ ] Code lives in pm33-claude-execution/app/frontend/ - [ ] Cross-references work between both directories
