# PM33 Icon & Button Standardization - Manual Testing Checklist

## Overview
This manual testing checklist complements automated tests by validating visual quality, user experience, and edge cases that require human judgment. Complete this checklist after running automated tests and before implementing standardization changes.

## Pre-Testing Setup

### Environment Preparation

- [ ] Browser developer tools open (F12)
- [ ] Test in both Chrome and Safari (webkit differences matter)
- [ ] Clear browser cache and disable extensions
- [ ] Set browser zoom to 100% for consistent testing

### Testing Tools
- [ ] Have automated test results available for reference
- [ ] Screen recording software ready (for capturing bugs)
- [ ] Note-taking app open for documenting issues
- [ ] Color picker tool available (browser dev tools eyedropper)

## Section 1: Icon Visual Quality Assessment

### Test Each Page: `/`, `/pricing`, `/about`, `/contact`, `/resources`, `/trial`

#### Icon Visibility (Light Mode)
- [ ] **Hero Section Icons**: All icons clearly visible with dark text on light backgrounds
- [ ] **Benefits Section Icons**: Strategic Intelligence, Execution Speed, Business Impact icons all readable
- [ ] **Trust Signal Icons**: Checkmarks next to "14-day free trial", "No credit card", etc. clearly visible
- [ ] **Social Proof Icons**: User, trending, star, rocket icons in metrics section readable
- [ ] **Security Badge Icons**: Shield, lock, check icons in enterprise security section visible
- [ ] **Navigation Icons**: All navigation elements and CTAs have proper contrast

**Expected Standard**: All icons should have white/light backgrounds with dark text for maximum contrast.

#### Icon Visibility (Dark Mode)
- [ ] Toggle to dark mode using theme toggle button
- [ ] **Hero Section Icons**: Icons maintain readability in dark theme
- [ ] **Benefits Section Icons**: All benefit icons remain visible and clear
- [ ] **Trust Signal Icons**: Checkmarks still clearly visible
- [ ] **Social Proof Icons**: All metric icons readable against dark background
- [ ] **Security Badge Icons**: Enterprise security icons maintain visibility
- [ ] **Navigation Icons**: Theme-aware icons adapt properly

**Expected Standard**: Icons should adapt to dark mode while maintaining excellent contrast ratios.

#### Theme Switching Test
- [ ] **Rapid Switching**: Click theme toggle 5 times rapidly - no icons disappear or flash
- [ ] **Smooth Transitions**: Theme changes are smooth, no jarring color shifts
- [ ] **Persistence**: Theme choice persists when navigating between pages
- [ ] **No Invisible States**: During transition, no icons become temporarily invisible
- [ ] **Color Consistency**: Icons maintain brand colors (#667eea, #764ba2, #10b981)

### Icon Size Consistency
- [ ] **Small Icons** (20px): Inline icons like checkmarks are consistently sized
- [ ] **Medium Icons** (32px): Card icons and section headers use consistent medium size
- [ ] **Large Icons** (48px): Hero and main feature icons use consistent large size
- [ ] **Proportional Scaling**: Icons scale proportionally on mobile/tablet/desktop

### Brand Compliance
- [ ] **PM33 Colors**: Icons use official brand colors: #667eea (blue), #764ba2 (purple), #10b981 (green)
- [ ] **Gradient Usage**: Branded icons use proper PM33 gradient: `linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%)`
- [ ] **White Backgrounds**: Standard icons use white backgrounds for maximum accessibility
- [ ] **No Off-Brand Colors**: No icons use colors outside the approved brand palette
