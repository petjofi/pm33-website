## 🧪 Test Suite Components

### 1. Visual Regression Testing
**File**: `tests/icon-button-standardization.spec.ts`
**Purpose**: Screenshot comparison to detect visual changes

```bash
# Run visual regression tests
npm run test:icons-buttons

# Update baseline screenshots (after confirming changes are intentional)
npm run test:icons-buttons-baseline
```

**What it tests**:
- Full page screenshots across themes (light/dark) and viewports (mobile/tablet/desktop)
- Individual icon screenshots for detailed comparison
- Individual button screenshots including hover states
- Critical element visibility across all pages

### 2. Contrast Validation (WCAG Compliance)
**File**: `tests/contrast-validation.spec.ts`
**Purpose**: Ensures accessibility standards are met

```bash
# Run contrast validation
npm run test:contrast-wcag
```

**What it tests**:
- WCAG AA compliance (4.5:1 minimum contrast ratio)
- Color-blind accessibility simulation
- Brand color compliance with accessibility standards
- Gradient background contrast calculations
- Theme-specific contrast validation

### 3. Theme Switching Stability
**File**: `tests/theme-switching-stability.spec.ts`
**Purpose**: Validates smooth theme transitions without broken elements

```bash
# Run theme switching tests
npm run test:theme-stability
```

**What it tests**:
- Element visibility during theme transitions
- Theme persistence across page navigation
- Rapid theme switching stress testing
- Network delay tolerance during theme changes

### 4. Button Interaction Consistency
**File**: `tests/button-interaction-consistency.spec.ts`
**Purpose**: Ensures all buttons have proper interactive feedback

```bash
# Run button interaction tests
npm run test:button-interactions
```

**What it tests**:
- Hover state consistency

## 📊 Understanding Test Results

### Test Status Meanings
- **PASS** ✅: All criteria met, ready for production
- **WARNING** ⚠️: Minor issues that should be addressed but don't block deployment
- **FAIL** ❌: Critical issues that must be fixed before deployment
- **CRITICAL_FAIL** 🚨: Accessibility violations or major functionality breaks

### Pass/Fail Criteria
```javascript
thresholds: {
  contrastRatio: 4.5,          // WCAG AA minimum
  stabilityRate: 95,           // 95% theme switching stability required
  buttonConsistency: 90,       // 90% button interaction consistency required
  criticalElementUptime: 100,  // 100% critical elements must work
  visualRegressionTolerance: 1 // 1% pixel difference allowed
}
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Development server not accessible"
```bash
# Check if server is running
curl -I http://localhost:3008

# Start development server
npm run dev
# or
PORT=3008 npm run dev
```

#### "No test results found"
- Tests may have failed to run completely
- Check `test-results/` directory exists
- Review test output for error messages
- Ensure Playwright is properly installed

#### "Screenshot comparison failures"
- Visual changes detected since last baseline
- Review screenshots in `test-results/` directory
- If changes are intentional: `npm run test:icons-buttons-baseline`
- If changes are unintentional: investigate and fix issues

#### "Contrast validation failures"
- Elements failing WCAG AA standards (4.5:1 ratio)
- Use browser dev tools color picker to verify colors
- Adjust colors or backgrounds to meet standards
- Consider using high-contrast color combinations

#### "Theme switching instability"
- Elements becoming invisible during theme transitions
- Check CSS classes for theme-aware styling
- Verify static theme classes are applied correctly
- Review theme transition timing and effects

### Performance Optimization

#### Speed Up Test Execution
```bash
# Run tests in parallel (default)
npm run test:icons-buttons

# Run on single browser only
npm run test:contrast-wcag -- --project=chromium

# Skip slow visual regression tests
npm run test:contrast-wcag
npm run test:theme-stability
npm run test:button-interactions
```

#### Reduce Screenshot Noise
```bash
# Disable animations during tests (already configured)
# Tests automatically disable CSS transitions and animations

# Update snapshots if fonts/rendering changed
npm run test:icons-buttons-baseline
```

## 📝 Test Development

### Adding New Tests

#### 1. Extend Test Map
Edit `tests/icon-button-test-map.ts`:
```typescript
// Add new page
{
  path: '/new-page',
  name: 'New Page',
  hasThemeToggle: true,
  icons: [...],
  buttons: [...]
}

// Add new icon test case
{
  id: 'new-icon-id',
  selector: '.new-icon-selector',
  component: 'Component name',
  expectedBackground: 'white',
  expectedTextColor: 'dark',
  size: 'medium',
  purpose: 'What this icon represents'
}
```

#### 2. Add Custom Validations
Extend existing test files with new test cases:
```typescript
test('Custom validation requirement', async ({ page }) => {
  // Custom test logic
});
```

#### 3. Update Pass/Fail Criteria
Modify thresholds in `scripts/run-standardization-tests.js`:
```javascript
thresholds: {
  newMetric: 90,  // Add new threshold
  // Adjust existing thresholds as needed
}
```

### Best Practices for Test Maintenance

1. **Keep Test Map Updated**: Add new pages/components as they're created
2. **Review Baselines Regularly**: Update screenshots when design intentionally changes  
3. **Monitor Test Performance**: Keep test execution time under 5 minutes
4. **Document Changes**: Update this guide when adding new test categories
5. **Version Control**: Commit baseline screenshots with code changes
