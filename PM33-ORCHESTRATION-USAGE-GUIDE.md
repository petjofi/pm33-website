## üìã **DAILY OPERATIONS WORKFLOW**

### Morning Briefing Generation
```python
import asyncio
from pm33-orchestration.master_orchestrator import PM33MasterOrchestrator

async def generate_daily_briefing():
    orchestrator = PM33MasterOrchestrator()
    briefing = await orchestrator.generate_daily_briefing()
    
    # Briefing includes:
    # - urgent_decisions_needed
    # - day_3_progress  
    # - strategic_approvals
    # - ux_reviews
    # - gtm_strategy_items
    # - technical_progress
    # - agentic_ai_teams_status
    # - conflicts_resolved
    # - scope_optimization_available
    
    return briefing
```

### Agent Decision Making
```python
# Technical Agent API Decision
tech_decision = await orchestrator.technical_agent.make_decision({
    "type": "api_endpoint_development",
    "endpoint": "/api/strategic/multi-ai",
    "purpose": "Multi-AI team coordination for PM33"
})

# Strategy Agent Competitive Analysis
strategy_decision = await orchestrator.strategy_agent.make_decision({
    "type": "competitive_analysis", 
    "competitive_context": "New AI PM tool launched"
})
```

### Human Escalation Processing
```python
from pm33-orchestration.human_interface.daily_briefing import HumanDecisionInterface

# Initialize human interface
human_interface = HumanDecisionInterface(orchestrator)

# Process human decisions (example format)
decisions = {
    "decisions": [
        {
            "id": "escalation_20250818_123456", 
            "type": "strategic_approval",
            "agent": "strategy",
            "approval": "approve",
            "modifications": {
                "timeline": "expedite for Day 3 launch"
            }
        }
    ]
}

await human_interface.process_human_decisions(decisions)
```

## üîÑ **SCOPE OPTIMIZATION WORKFLOW**

### Weekly Scope Review
```python
# Conduct scope optimization review
scope_review = await orchestrator.conduct_scope_review()

# Review includes agent suggestions for:
# - Authority expansion requests
# - Cross-agent collaboration opportunities  
# - Efficiency bottlenecks identified
# - Authority improvements based on performance

# Example suggestions from Technical Agent:
{
    "authority_expansion_requests": {
        "database_schema_full_authority": {
            "justification": "Have complete context from PM33_DATA_REQUIREMENTS_ARCHITECTURE.md",
            "efficiency_gain": "Eliminate escalation delays for schema decisions",
            "risk_level": "LOW - well-documented requirements"
        }
    }
}
```

## üîß **CONFLICT RESOLUTION SYSTEM**

### Automatic Conflict Resolution
```python
from pm33-orchestration.master_orchestrator import Conflict, EscalationLevel

# Create conflict
conflict = Conflict(
    id="tech_ux_001",
    agents_involved=["technical", "ux"],
    conflict_type="technical_vs_ux", 
    description="Component styling disagreement with user experience impact",
    business_impact=7,
    urgency=EscalationLevel.DAILY,
    resolution_needed_by=datetime.now(),
    agent_positions={
        "technical": "Performance optimization priority",
        "ux": "User experience priority"
    }
)

# System resolves automatically using PM33-specific rules
await orchestrator.handle_conflict(conflict)
```

## üìä **CONTEXT MANAGEMENT**

### Relevant Context Loading
The system loads ONLY relevant context files for each agent:

**Technical Agent Context:**
- PROVEN_WORKFLOW_PATTERNS.md
- PM33_DATA_REQUIREMENTS_ARCHITECTURE.md  
- PM33_UX_ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md
- app/frontend/package.json
- app/backend/main.py

**Strategy Agent Context:**
- INSTRUCTIONS-FOR-FUTURE-AGENTS.md
- STRATEGIC-CONTEXT-REQUIREMENTS.md
- strategy/competitive-analysis/
- strategy/context/competitive/
- ../PM33/pm33_100k_mrr_plan.md (Revenue strategy & competitive analysis)
- ../PM33/final drafts/ (Strategic marketing alignment)
- ../PM33/Templates/ (Strategic content templates)

**UX Agent Context:**
- PM33_UX_ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md

## üéØ **DAY 3 BETA LAUNCH OPERATIONS**

### Launch Readiness Assessment
```python
# Get Day 3 specific progress
day_3_progress = await orchestrator.assess_day_3_progress()

# Returns current status:
{
    "beta_signups": {"target": 15, "actual": 0, "status": "not_started"},
    "demo_readiness": {
        "strategic_chat": "‚úÖ operational",
        "command_center": "üîÑ in_development", 
        "ai_teams_demo": "‚è≥ planned",
        "interactive_workflows": "‚è≥ planned"
    },
    "marketing_execution": {
        "outreach_plan": "‚úÖ ready",
        "demo_positioning": "‚úÖ updated", 
        "viral_mechanics": "üîÑ in_development"
    },
    "timeline_risk": "MEDIUM - Strategic Command Center critical path"
}
```

## üîÑ **SESSION MANAGEMENT & CONTEXT MAINTENANCE**

### RECOMMENDED: Continue Using pm33-session-manager.py ‚úÖ

**Answer to "Should I still use my python3 pm33-session-manager.py":**
**YES - Continue using it. Here's why:**

```bash
# Your session manager is optimized for PM33 workflows
python3 pm33-session-manager.py --start

# It already loads:
‚úÖ All strategic context files (INSTRUCTIONS-FOR-FUTURE-AGENTS.md, etc.)
‚úÖ Marketing strategy ($100K MRR plan) 
‚úÖ Approved marketing content (PM33/final drafts/, PM33/Templates/)
‚úÖ Technical architecture and orchestration system
‚úÖ Competitive intelligence and positioning
‚úÖ Day 3 beta launch context
```

**Benefits of pm33-session-manager.py:**
- **Context Continuity**: Maintains PM33 context between Claude Code sessions
- **Marketing Integration**: Now includes $100K MRR plan and approved content
- **Orchestration Ready**: Loads agent system with relevant context mapping
- **Proven Patterns**: Uses proven workflow patterns you've developed

### Context Maintenance Best Practices

**1. Between Sessions:**
```bash
# Session manager handles context persistence automatically
# Shared context saved to: pm33-orchestration/state_management/shared_context.json
# Agent states maintained via shared context updates
# Decision history preserved in conflict logs
```

**2. Daily Operations:**
```bash
# After starting with session manager, generate daily briefing
python3 -c "
import asyncio, sys, os
sys.path.append('.')
from pm33_orchestration.master_orchestrator import PM33MasterOrchestrator

async def brief():
    orchestrator = PM33MasterOrchestrator()
    briefing = await orchestrator.generate_daily_briefing()
    print('=== PM33 DAILY BRIEFING ===')
    for key, value in briefing.items():
        print(f'{key}: {value}')

asyncio.run(brief())
"
```

**3. Marketing Strategy Integration:**
The agents now understand:
- **$100K MRR Plan**: Revenue model, pricing ($49-149/user/month), competitive analysis
- **Keyword-Based Growth**: Organic marketing strategy with 10+ pieces/week
- **Approved Content**: PM33/final drafts/ and PM33/Templates/ are active marketing materials
- **Content Automation**: Claude Code-centric development and marketing automation framework

## üìö **AGENT USAGE INSTRUCTIONS & BEST PRACTICES**

### Individual Agent Usage
```python
# Import and use specific agents
import sys, os
sys.path.append('.')
from pm33_orchestration.master_orchestrator import PM33MasterOrchestrator

# Initialize orchestrator (loads all agents)
orchestrator = PM33MasterOrchestrator()

# Use Technical Agent for autonomous development
tech_decision = await orchestrator.technical_agent.make_decision({
    "type": "api_endpoint_development",
    "endpoint": "/api/strategic/analysis", 
    "purpose": "Strategic analysis API endpoint"
})

# Use GTM Agent for content creation (now includes marketing strategy context)
gtm_decision = await orchestrator.gtm_agent.make_decision({
    "type": "content_creation",
    "content_type": "blog_post",
    "topic": "PMO transformation with AI teams"
})
```

### Best Practices
1. **Start with Session Manager**: Always use `python3 pm33-session-manager.py --start`
2. **Check Agent Context**: Agents load only relevant files - Technical doesn't see marketing, GTM doesn't see database schemas
3. **Marketing Strategy Aware**: GTM and Strategy agents now understand $100K MRR plan and approved content
4. **Daily Briefings**: Generate briefings to track progress and pending decisions
5. **Scope Optimization**: Weekly reviews to expand agent autonomy based on performance

## üí° **QUICK ANSWERS TO YOUR QUESTIONS**

**Q: Where can I get instructions for using agents and best practices?**
**A**: This guide (PM33-ORCHESTRATION-USAGE-GUIDE.md) + individual agent files have detailed usage patterns.

**Q: How will I maintain context between sessions?**
**A**: Continue using `pm33-session-manager.py` - it maintains PM33 context automatically and is now integrated with marketing strategy.

**Q: Should I still use python3 pm33-session-manager.py?**
**A**: YES - It's optimized for PM33, loads marketing strategy, maintains context between sessions, and works perfectly with the orchestration system.
