### **Closed-Loop Iterative Testing**
```
Code Change → Pre-commit Tests → CI/CD Pipeline → Quality Gates → Deployment → Post-Deploy Validation → Continuous Improvement
```

### **Automated Quality Gates**
- **Pre-commit Hooks** - Block commits with failing critical tests
- **GitHub Actions** - Comprehensive validation before merge
- **Lighthouse CI** - Performance and accessibility enforcement  
- **Security Scanning** - npm audit + CodeQL analysis
